# Adventure-Game-Node-project
This TypeScript adventure game allows players to enter their name and choose an opponent: Skeleton, Assassin, or Zombie. Players can Attack, Drink, or Run. Attacks decrease fuel, Drinks restore it. The game ends when the player's or the opponent's fuel hits zero. It uses inquirer for interactive prompts and chalk for styled output.
